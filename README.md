# Turn-based-fightsystem
This is my first attempt making a game (or a part of a game).
I'm also a totaly scrub in GitHub.
So I hope I dont confuse too much.
To me: I finished the tutorials "making games" and "invent with python" for learning python.
I worked on this code for a month and i have now a working turn based rpg game.
There is a lot missing, but you have already some actions you and the AI can do.

Sorry for my english.
